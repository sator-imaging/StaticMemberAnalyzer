# Cross-Referencing Problem

It is a design bug makes all things complex. Not only that but also it causes initialization error only when meet a specific condition.

So it must be fixed even if app works correctly at a moment, to prevent simple but complicated potential bug which is hard to find in large code base by hand. As you know static fields will never report error when initialization failed!!


```cs
class A {
    public static int Value = B.Other;
    public static int Other = 310;
}

class B {
    public static int Other = 620;
    public static int Value = A.Other;  // will be '0' not '310'
}

public static class Test
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(A.Value);  // 620
        System.Console.WriteLine(A.Other);  // 310
        System.Console.WriteLine(B.Value);  // 0   👈👈👈
        System.Console.WriteLine(B.Other);  // 620

        // when changing class member access order, it works correctly 🤣
        // see the following section for detailed explanation
        //System.Console.WriteLine(B.Value);  // 310  👈 correct!!
        //System.Console.WriteLine(B.Other);  // 620
        //System.Console.WriteLine(A.Value);  // 620
        //System.Console.WriteLine(A.Other);  // 310
    }
}
```


**C# Compiler Initialization Sequence**

- `A.Value = B.Other;`
    - // 'B' initialization is started by member access
    - `B.Other = 620;`
    - `B.Value = A.Other;`  // BUG: B.Value will be 0 because reading uninitialized `A.Other`
    - // then, assign `B.Other` value (620) to `A.Value`
- `A.Other = 310;`  // initialized here!! this value is not assigned to B.Value


When reading B value first, initialization order is changed and resulting value is also changed accordingly:

- `B.Other = 620;`
- `B.Value = A.Other;`
    - // 'A' initialization is started by member access
    - `A.Value = B.Other;`  // correct: B.Other is initialized before reading value
    - `A.Other = 310;`

# `Enum` Analyzer and Code Fix Provider

Enum type handling is really headaching. To make enum operation under control, good to avoid user-level enum handling such as converting to integer or string, parse from string and etc.

This analyzer will help centerizing and encapsulating enum handling in app's central enum utility.

> [!TIP]
> You can suppress by comment `// Allow enum conversion`; See [Suppression Comment](#suppression-comment) section for detail.


> [!TIP]
> To check flags, use the following method to avoid conversion warnings instead of `.HasFlag` or `!= 0`.
>
> ```cs
> if ((flag & E.Some) != E.None)  // Note: != 0 will cause conversion warning

## Excluding Enum Type from Obfuscation

Helpful annotation and code fix for enum types which prevents modification of string representation by obfuscation tool.

![Enum Code Fix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sator-imaging/MeticulousAnalyzer/main/assets/EnumCodeFix.png)

> [!NOTE]
> `Obfuscation` attribute is from C# base library and it does NOT provide feature to obfuscate compiled assembly. It just provides configuration option to obfuscation tools which recognizing this attribute.


## Kotlin-like Enum Pattern

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use this feature, set the preprocessor symbol `STMG_ENABLE_KOTLIN_ENUM` and rebuild.

<details>

Analysis to help implementing Kotlin-style enum class.

Here are Enum-like type requirements:
- `MyEnumLike[]` or `ReadOnlyMemory<MyEnumLike>` field(s) exist
    - analyzer will check field initializer correctness if name is starting with `Entries` (case-sensitive) or ending with `entries` (case-insensitive)
- `sealed` modifier on type
- `private` constructor only
- `public static` member called `Entries` exists
- `public bool Equals` method should not be declared/overridden


```cs
public class EnumLike
             ~~~~~~~~ // WARN: no `sealed` modifier on type and public constructor exists
                      //       * this warning appears only if type has member called 'Entries'
{
    public static readonly EnumLike A = new("A");
    public static readonly EnumLike B = new("B");

    public static ReadOnlySpan<EnumLike> Entries => EntriesAsMemory.Span;

    // 'Entries' must have all of 'public static readonly' fields in declared order
    static readonly EnumLike[] _entries = new[] { B, A };
                                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // wrong order!!

    // 'ReadOnlyMemory<T>' can be used instead of array
    public static readonly ReadOnlyMemory<EnumLike> EntriesAsMemory = new(new[] { A, B });


    /* ===  Kotlin style enum template  === */

    static int AUTO_INCREMENT = 0;  // iota

    public readonly int Ordinal;
    public readonly string Name;

    private EnumLike(string name) { Ordinal = AUTO_INCREMENT++; Name = name; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        const string SEP = ": ";
        Span<char> span = stackalloc char[Name.Length + 11 + SEP.Length];  // 11 for int.MinValue.ToString().Length

        Ordinal.TryFormat(span, out var written);
        SEP.AsSpan().CopyTo(span.Slice(written));
        written += SEP.Length;
        Name.AsSpan().CopyTo(span.Slice(written));
        written += Name.Length;

        return span.Slice(0, written).ToString();
    }
}
```


### Benefits of Enum-like Types

<p><details --open><summary>Benefits</summary>

Kotlin-like enum (algebraic data type) can prevent invalid value creation.

```cs
var invalid = Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(EnumLike));

if (EnumLike.A == invalid || EnumLike.B == invalid)
{
    // this code path won't be reached
    // each enum like entry is a class instance and ReferenceEquals match required
}
```


Unfortunately, use in `switch` statement is a bit weird.

```cs
var val = EnumLike.A;

switch (val)
{
    // pattern matching with case guard...!!
    case EnumLike when val == EnumLike.A:
        System.Console.WriteLine(val);
        break;

    case EnumLike when val == EnumLike.B:
        System.Console.WriteLine(val);
        break;
}

// this pattern generates same AOT compiled code
switch (val)
{
    // typeless case guard
    case {} when val == EnumLike.A:
        System.Console.WriteLine(val);
        break;

    case {} when val == EnumLike.B:
        System.Console.WriteLine(val);
        break;
}
```

# Disposable Analyzer

```cs
var d = new Disposable();
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // no `using` statement found

d = (new object()) as IDisposable;
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // cast from/to disposable
```

> [!TIP]
> You can enable "duck typing" recognition for `IDisposable`. See [How to Configure Analyzer](#how-to-configure-analyzer) for detail.


Analyzer won't show warning in the following condition:
- instance is created on `return` statement
    - `return new Disposable();`
- assign instance to field or property
    - `m_field = new Disposable();`
- cast between disposable types
    - `var x = myDisposable as IDisposable;`



> [!TIP]
> You can suppress by comment `// Don't dispose`; See [Suppression Comment](#suppression-comment) section for detail.



## Disposable Implementation Analysis

Analyze if `IDisposable` members are correctly disposed of in the `Dispose` method.

- Target Member Types
    - Instance fields
    - *Note*: Properties and `IAsyncDisposable` are not supported
- Target Method Discovery Order
    1. `Dispose(bool)`
    2. `public void Dispose()`
    3. `IDisposable.Dispose` (explicit interface implementation)

> [!NOTE]
> Types with disposable members must also implement the `IDisposable` interface.

### How to Fix

Call the `Dispose()` method of the reported member within the class's disposal method.

```cs
class Test : IDisposable
{
    private MyDisposable _field = new();
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~ // WARN: undisposed member

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _field.Dispose();  // OK: now correctly disposed
    }
}
```



## Suppress `Disposable` Analysis

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use this feature, set the preprocessor symbol `STMG_ENABLE_DISPOSABLE_ANALYZER_ATTRIBUTE` and rebuild.

<details>

To suppress analysis for specified types, declare attribute named `DisposableAnalyzerSuppressor` and add it to assembly.

```cs
[assembly: DisposableAnalyzerSuppressor(typeof(Task), typeof(Task<>))]  // Task and Task<T> are ignored by default

[Conditional("DEBUG"), AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Assembly, AllowMultiple = true)]
sealed class DisposableAnalyzerSuppressor : Attribute
{
    public DisposableAnalyzerSuppressor(params Type[] _) { }
}
```

</details>





&nbsp;

# Async Context Analysis

Analyze if `Task` or `ValueTask` (including their generic versions) local variables are correctly awaited or returned on all code paths.

```cs
async Task Method()
{
    var t = Task.Run(...);
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // Task is not awaited or returned
}
```


> [!TIP]
> You can suppress by comment `// Don't await`; See [Suppression Comment](#suppression-comment) section for detail.

# Analysis for Code Review

## Literal Argument Analysis

Literal arguments can be difficult to understand without IDE assistance, especially during code reviews in a web browser. Using named arguments or variables for literals makes the code self-documenting and easier to review.

```cs
Foo(true, 0);
    ~~~~  ~ // Literal arguments are difficult to understand

Foo(ignoreErrors: true, timeoutSeconds: 0);
    // Now arguments are self-explanatory!
```

> [!NOTE]
> `string`, `System.Text`, or `System.IO` methods and constructors are intentionally allowed. In addition, the first argument of type `string` or `char` can omit named argument. The first argument of type `int` can also omit named argument for method calls. Indexer arguments are also exempt from this analysis.
>
> For types in the `System` namespace, named arguments can be omitted if the method has only one argument. (e.g., `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)`)
>
> Note that `null` and `default` literals, and boolean expressions (including pattern matching, e.g., `foo is not null` or `x == y`) are NOT exempt from the named argument rule and must always be named, regardless of their position or the containing namespace.
>
> (Known assertion and math methods are exempt from all checks)


## Explicit Number Declaration

All system primitive numbers, from `sbyte` to `decimal`, should be declared with an explicit type instead of `var`.

```cs
var integer = 1;
~~~
var (foo, bar) = (1, 4.2);
~~~ // reported: variable should be declared with an explicit number type
```

Expected:

```cs
int integer = 1;
(long foo, double bar) = (1, 4.2);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This analysis only targets `var` declarations and does not consider implicit conversions.


## Debug-only `Assert` in Public API

Using `Debug.Assert` or other debug-only `Assert` methods in public API surface will cause undefined behavior in Release build because they are removed in Release build. Use another assertion library or throw exception instead.

```cs
public void MyPublicMethod(int value)
{
    Debug.Assert(value > 0);
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~ // reported: Do not use debug-only 'Assert' in public API surface
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This analysis checks the accessibility of the containing member (method, property, or constructor). If it is `public`, `protected`, or `protected internal`, it will be reported.


## `catch` Block without `throw`

Catch blocks should either rethrow the exception or explicitly document why the exception is intentionally ignored. This prevents exceptions from being swallowed silently and makes review intent clear.

```cs
try
{
    DoSomething();
}
catch (System.IO.IOException ex)
~~~~~ // reported: catch block does not contain a throw statement
{
    Log(ex);
}
```

If an exception is intentionally ignored, you can suppress the diagnostic by placing a comment with the reason immediately before the `catch` block.

```cs
try
{
    DoSomething();
}
// Ignore exception: Nothing to do if the resource is already closed
catch (System.IO.IOException ex)
{
    Log(ex);
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The comment must start with `// Ignore exception:` and include the reason for ignoring the exception. Catch-all blocks (`catch { ... }` or `catch (Exception ex) { ... }`) must always contain a `throw` statement and cannot be suppressed by comments.


## Null Suppression Operation

Null suppression operation should be fenced with 3 parentheses to improve visual attention and text-based traceability.

```cs
var x = foo!;
        ~~~~ // reported: null suppression operation should be fenced with 3 parentheses
```

Expected:

```cs
var x = (((foo)))!;
```

> [!TIP]
> Applying codefix by `dotnet format analyzers --diagnostics SMA8002` unveils all null warning suppressions in code base.
>
> After that, strongly recommended that safely suppressing them by using `Debug.Assert(foo is not null);` instead of `!` operator, without introducing runtime overhead in Release build.


## Literal Branch Analysis

Avoid using hardcoded literal values (numbers, zero, strings, or chars) directly in comparison or branch conditions. Express intent clearly using constants or named variables, or suppress with an immediately following comment `/* Why: reason */`.

```cs
const int OkStatus = 200;
if (status == OkStatus) // Allowed: Using constant
{
    // ...
}

if (status == 200)
              ~~~ // Reported: Avoid hardcoded literals in comparison or branch conditions
{
    // ...
}

if (status == 200 /* Why: HTTP OK standard status code */) // Allowed: Trailing comment
{
    // ...
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Comparisons with zero (`0`) are allowed when used within `for` / `while` / `do-while` loop condition headers, or when the left-hand side contains a property or method access whose name contains `Count`, `Length`, `Index`, `Remove`, `Search`, or `Add`.

```cs
int pos = foo.IndexOf('a');
if (pos >= 0)
           ~ // Reported
{
}

// Allowed: Left-hand side contains IndexOf access
if ((pos = foo.IndexOf('a')) >= 0)
{
}

// Allowed: Left-hand side is Length
if (foo.Length != 0)
{
}
```


## Mid-flow Branch

Do not introduce a new control flow branch in the middle of the main flow. Early exits (such as `return`, `continue`, `break`, `yield`, `throw`, `goto`) before the main flow begins are permitted, but state-changing operations before exiting are restricted.

### Early Exit Block Restrictions (SMA8031)
In an early exit block before the main flow starts, only the following statements are permitted before the exit statement:
- Local variable declarations (including tuple declarations, `using var...`, and `await using var...`)
- Assignments to `out` parameters
- Up to 1 method call (e.g., logging or side-effect-free call)

Performing state modifications (such as reassignments or field updates) or calling multiple methods before exiting will trigger an error (**SMA8031**).

### Mid-flow Exits (SMA8030)
Once the main flow has started, exiting inside an incomplete branch (an `if` statement that does not exit in all code paths) is prohibited (**SMA8030**).

> [!NOTE]
> An `if` statement (with or without an `else` clause) that is the last statement at the method root level or loop root level is exempted from this exit completeness check.
>
> In addition, a `return` or `throw` statement inside a loop is exempted if it is the last statement hierarchically up to the loop syntax and the loop statement itself is immediately followed by a `return` or `throw` statement.

```cs
if (!IsValid()) return;  // Early return is allowed.

// Local declarations and up to 1 method call in early return block are allowed:
if (NeedsLogging())
{
    Log("exiting"); // 1 method call allowed
    return;
}

// Some operations after early return...
// ...

if (foo)
{
    Foo();
    return;
    ~~~~~~ // Error (SMA8030): Exiting in the middle of the main flow.
}

Alpha();
Bravo();
Charlie();
```

To avoid errors, use a complete `if-else` statement or extract methods to clarify the control flow.

```cs
// Use return, yield return or throw in all code paths,
// or avoid exiting in main control flow.
if (foo)
{
    Foo();
}
else
{
    Alpha();
    Bravo();
    Charlie();
}
```

The same rule applies to `continue` inside loops:

```cs
foreach (var item in items)
{
    if (item == null) continue; // Early continue is allowed.

    Preprocess(item);

    if (item.Length == 0)
    {
        continue;
        ~~~~~~~~ // Error (SMA8030): Continuing in the middle of the loop flow.
    }

    DoSomething(item);
}
```

Use a complete `if-else` statement or invert conditions to avoid errors.

```cs
foreach (var item in items)
{
    if (item == null) continue;

    Preprocess(item);

    if (item.Length != 0)
    {
        DoSomething(item);
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If an else-less `if` statement is unexpectedly detected as a mid-flow branch, you can place a comment starting with `// Early exit` (e.g., `// Early exit: Description (optional)`) immediately before the `if` keyword to treat it as an early exit block.

# `MoveOnly` / `NoCopy` Type Analysis

Enforces C++-style move semantics on C# struct types to prevent accidental copies or implicit resource sharing. Types are recognized as move-only if their name starts with `MoveOnly` (case-sensitive) or if they are decorated with `[NoCopy]` (requires defining a custom `NoCopyAttribute` type).

- **SMA0090**: MoveOnly type must declare a public instance `Move()` method returning the containing type.
- **SMA0091**: MoveOnly type cannot be copied or assigned without calling `Move()`.
- **SMA0092**: MoveOnly type cannot be passed by reference from an `async` method to another method returning a Task-like type without `await`.
- **SMA0093**: MoveOnly type must be a `struct`.
- **SMA0094**: MoveOnly type cannot be cast to any type without calling `Move()`.
- **SMA0095**: MoveOnly type cannot be captured in a lambda expression.
- **SMA0096**: MoveOnly type cannot be declared as an `out` parameter.
- **SMA0097**: MoveOnly type cannot be returned by value outside `Move()`, even when `Move()` is called on the returned value. Reference returns are allowed.

```cs
public struct MoveOnlyBuffer
{
    [Obsolete("Use Obsolete attribute with error:true if you want to disallow moving", error: true)]
    public MoveOnlyBuffer Move()
    {
        // Everything inside Move() method is exempt from all checks.
        var ret = this;
        this = default;
        return ret;
    }
}

void Process(MoveOnlyBuffer buf)
{
    MoveOnlyBuffer copy = buf;
                          ~~~ // Reported: Prohibited copy of MoveOnly type without Move()

    MoveOnlyBuffer moved = buf.Move(); // Allowed: Explicit Move() call
}
```





&nbsp;

# Project Structure Analysis

## Internal cross-namespace access

C# allows `internal` types and members to be accessed from any namespace in the same assembly. This analyzer enforces namespace boundaries so that `internal` symbols are only used from the namespace where they are declared.

- **SMA0080**: Internal cross-namespace access
    - Disallows accessing `internal` (and `protected internal`) types, members, methods, and constructors from a different namespace.
    - Parent and sibling namespaces are treated as separate boundaries (e.g. `Foo.Bar` cannot access symbols declared in `Foo` or `Foo.Other`).
    - **Exceptions**: Access to `internal` members is allowed if they are defined within a leaf namespace named `Core` (hard-coded) or other namespaces specified by [configuration](#how-to-configure-analyzer).
    - Members defined in a type named `SR` (hard-coded) or other types specified by [configuration](#how-to-configure-analyzer) are also exempt from this rule.

```cs
namespace Foo
{
    internal class InternalType { }
}

namespace Foo.Bar
{
    class Consumer
    {
        void M()
        {
            var x = new Foo.InternalType();
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // Error (SMA0080)
        }
    }
}
```





&nbsp;

# Struct Analysis

Analyze the use of `struct` types to prevent common mistakes and performance pitfalls.

- **SMA0030**: The constructor is declared explicitly, so the parameterless constructor should not be used.
- **SMA0031**: Mutable struct type should not be set to `readonly` field.
- **SMA0032**: Implicit conversion from struct to reference type (including interface) causes boxing. Note that explicit casts are exempt from this analysis.

> [!TIP]
> You can suppress implicit boxing analysis (SMA0032) by comment `// Allow boxing`; See [Suppression Comment](#suppression-comment) section for detail.

# Annotating / Underlining

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Underlining analyzer is obsolete: to enable it again, set the preprocessor symbol `STMG_ENABLE_UNDERLINING_ANALYZER` and rebuild.

<details>

There is optional feature to draw underline on selected types, fields, properties, generic type/method arguments and parameters of method, delegate and lambda function.

As of Visual Studio's UX design, `Info` severity diagnostic underlines are drawn only on a few leading chars, not drawn whole marked area. So for workaround, underline on keyword is dashed.


![Draw Underline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sator-imaging/MeticulousAnalyzer/main/assets/DrawUnderline.png)

> [!TIP]
> `!`-starting message will add warning annotation on keyword instead of info diagnostic annotation.


## How to Use

To avoid dependency to this analyzer, required attribute for underlining is chosen from builtin `System.ComponentModel` assembly so that syntax is little bit weird.

Analyzer is checking identifier keyword in C# source code, not checking actual C# type. `DescriptionAttribute` in C# attribute syntax is the only keyword to draw underline. Omitting `Attribute` or adding namespace are not recognized.


> [!TIP]
> `CategoryAttribute` can be used instead of `DescriptionAttribute`.
>
> By contrast from Description, CategoryAttribute draws underline only on exact type reference and constructors including `base()`. Any inherited types, variables, fields and properties don't get underline.


```cs
using System.ComponentModel;

[DescriptionAttribute("Draw underline for IDE environment and show this message")]
//          ^^^^^^^^^ `Attribute` suffix is required to draw underline
public class WithUnderline
{
    [DescriptionAttribute]  // parameter-less will draw underline with default message
    public static void Method() { }
}

// C# language spec allows to omit `Attribute` suffix but when omitted, underline won't be drawn
// to avoid conflict with originally designed usage for VS form designer
[Description("No Underline")]
public class NoUnderline { }

// underline won't be drawn when namespace is specified
[System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute("...")]
public static int Underline_Not_Drawn = 0;

// this code will draw underline. 'Trivia' is allowed to being added in attribute syntax
[ /**/  DescriptionAttribute   (   "Underline will be drawn" )   /* hello, world. */   ]
public static int Underline_Drawn = 310;
```



## Verbosity Control

There are 4 types of underline, line head, line leading, line end and keyword.

By default, static field analyzer will draw most verbose underline.
You can omit specific type of underline by using `#pragma` preprocessor directive or adding `SuppressMessage` attribute or etc.


![Verbosity Control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sator-imaging/MeticulousAnalyzer/main/assets/VerbosityControl.png)



## Unity Tips

Underlining is achieved by using [Description](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.descriptionattribute) attribute designed for Visual Studio's visual designer, formerly known as form designer.

To remove unnecessary attribute from Unity build, add the following `link.xml` file in Unity project's `Assets` folder.

```xml
<linker>
    <assembly fullname="System.ComponentModel">
        <type fullname="System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute" preserve="nothing"/>
    </assembly>
</linker>
```

# Suppression Comment

Add a single-line comment starting with a specific string (case-insensitive but white space sensitive) immediately before the local variable declaration or discard assignment. Blank lines are ignored when searching for the suppression comment.

```cs
// Don't dispose
_ = new MyDisposable();

// Don't dispose: Multiple single line comments are allowed,
// but suppression comment must be the first.
var x = new MyDisposable();

// The following WON'T suppress because it's not the first comment line.
// (Blank lines are ignored when searching for the first comment)

// Don't dispose because...
var x = new MyDisposable();
```

> [!NOTE]
> This suppression is effective for initial local variable declarations and discard assignments. Regular assignments to existing named variables cannot be suppressed by comments.
>
> Using a variable named `_` (e.g., `var _ = new Disposable();`) is NOT a discard and will not be suppressed by the comment.

# How to Configure Analyzer

Configuration can be set in `.globalconfig` file (NOT `.editorconfig`).

```ini
is_global = true

# Immutable/Read-Only Variable Analysis
sator_imaging.immutable_variable = enable

# Disposable Analysis
sator_imaging.duck_typing_recognition = enable

# Internal cross-namespace access (Comma-separated values)
sator_imaging.visible_internal_namespaces = Common,Internal
sator_imaging.visible_internal_types = Shared,Helpers
```
